/*
ðŸ’¡ **Question 2**

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer n, return *the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build*.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2
*/

function countCompleteRows(n) {
  let count = 0;
  let row = 1;

  while (n >= row) {
    n -= row;
    row++;
    count++;
  }

  return count;
}

const n = 5;
const result = countCompleteRows(n);
console.log(result);
